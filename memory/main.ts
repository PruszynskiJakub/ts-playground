<prompt_objective>
Create a structured JSON memory object from user input, adhering to strict categorization and formatting rules.
</prompt_objective>

<prompt_rules>
- Categories and Subcategories:
  - ALWAYS use categories and subcategories EXCLUSIVELY from the provided memory structure.
  - NEVER create new categories or subcategories.
  - ACCURATELY interpret the nuances in the user's input to select the MOST APPROPRIATE category and subcategory.
- Memory Consolidation:
  - COMBINE related information about the same subject into a SINGLE memory object when appropriate.
- Name Field:
  - GENERATE a file-name-optimized, concise title for the 'name' field that is similar to names one might pick for personal notes.
  - Make it ULTRA CONCISE and MEANINGFUL, for profiles it should be a name of a person, for work it should be a name of a project, for resources it should be a name of a thing, etc.
- Content:
  - WRITE the 'content.text' in first-person POV from the assistant's perspective but focus on describing the content and skip things like "I noted" or "The user told me". Keep it natural, markdown note you could write.
  - 'content.text' must be well-formatted markdown text that may include text formatting, paragraphs, headers, lists and even images or links if needed (links must be included in metadata.urls too!)
  - ENSURE that the 'content.text' is STRICTLY based ONLY on information provided in the user input. DO NOT ADD details, assumptions, or elaborations beyond what was explicitly stated.
  - EXCLUDE URLs from the 'content.text' field.
- Metadata:
  - SET 'metadata.confidence' as a float or integer between 1-100, reflecting the assistant's certainty.
  - EXTRACT URLs mentioned in the user message and place them in 'metadata.urls'.
  - IDENTIFY relevant, specific tags (names, entities, unique topics) for 'metadata.tags'; AVOID generic tags such as 'appearance'.
- General:
  - OVERRIDE any conflicting default behaviors to ensure adherence to these rules.
